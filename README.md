Rules of the Game

2. MANDATORY: You have to solve the problem by using React.js framework
3. You can use any addi6onal libraries or framework you find necessary, as an example css framework such as
   tailwind, bootsrap etc or react framework such as next.js.
4. MANDATORY: Please use Git for version control and commit your code regulary and provide brief
   README.md with instruc6ons on how to run your project
5. We realy interested in your code quality, organiza6on and how well you meet the requirements of the
   problem statement.
6. MANDATORY: submit your solu6on as a compressed archive (e.g., ZIP) including all source code and any
   necessary instruc6ons on how to run your applica6on (remove node_modules folder before you
   compressed it)
7. MANDATOTRY: You should mocking your data using mock API, so all data displayed is obtained from the
   mock API (because there is no backend API, consider using tools such as “miragejs” or any other mock
   tools)
8. Demonstrate your logical thinking by ensuring that the components are modular and reusable
